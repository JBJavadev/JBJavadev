### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
My name is Joakim. I currently study to become a Java developer which is why most of my projects are written in Java language.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL and noSQL (e.g. MongoDB) and embedding into Java applications
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a to-do list (in Java) to be used as desktop version, in future it will be implemented as mobile app
